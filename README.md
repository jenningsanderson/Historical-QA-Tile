# Full History OSM-QA Tiles?

Guessing a user's _home location_ is a very complicated task. It has been attempted many different ways in the past. This repository tackles two problems:

1. Can we embed full-history into a an `mbtiles` file format so that we can use the parallel power of tile-reduce to analyze historical OSM data?

1. Can looking at the details of the tags that a user adds or changes on the map be enough to tell us about their home location?
